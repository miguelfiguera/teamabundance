# READ THIS FIRST

Dear User,

Please be aware that this is just a single page. It only contains three files: index.html, index.css and **index.js**.

The file that contains all the text is the index.js file, as it is easier to change the content.

The content in that file is in the first half, it has some instructions on the top, and you can use them to change the content.

You can use any kind of text editor for this task. Notepad, Visual Studio Code (this one will highlight any mistakes), and other similar software.


Easy Steps:

1. You have to download a current copy of **index.js** from this link ---> github.com/miguelfiguera/teamabundance 

2. open the file with a text editor (notepad, visual studio code).

3. Find what text do you want to change, do it inside the quotation marks.

Note: You will see that some text is inside '' and some text is inside "".  this happens for a reason: if you use "" inside '' like this 'I am "miguel figuera"' everything works fine. but if you do 'I'm 'miguel figuera'' the code will break. (It can be fixed). The same way "I'm 'miguel figuera'" will work jut fine. **A group of quotation marks can be inside a different group of quotation marks but not inside the same group.**


4. Save the file with the same name. Open github.com/miguelfiguera/teamabundance and add the new copy, it will replace the previous one.

5. upload the copy. wait for 2 minutes and check the page link. It should show the new content.

If you have anykind of troubles, please be aware that you can write me through fiverr with no aditional cost the first 25 times. Yes, 25 times. I know this can be confusing and I understand that so you have up to 25 fixes for accidental changes. All the interaction inside a fix are counted as one (if the code has been changed by mistake, aestethics changes will requiere billing after the order is accepted).

Please follow the instructions on the top of the **index.js** and dont hesitate to ask.

Miguel Figuera.
